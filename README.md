# Hello-World

Hello

My name is Evan Beadle, I am a student at Georgia Southern studying for a CS degree
I am starting this project the day before it is due because I have a calc 2 test this Friday, 5 calc 2 HW assignments due thursday night, a Chem 2 lab due Thursday night, and I can't do any of those thursday because I work from 3:00-11:00 pm. Today I work from 3:00-8:00 pm, so I'll probably be up all night coding this.
